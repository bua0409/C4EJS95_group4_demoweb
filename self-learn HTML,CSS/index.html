              writer's block. His girlfriend, whom he's lived for eight years,
              has just left him, obstensibly because he has bee unable to write
              the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has
              been putting tgether. For solace and inspriration, he turns poets
              who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore
              Roethke,Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he
              finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of What i was
              doing." Of her poems he says,"They're very simple. And yet each
              has something."/p>
